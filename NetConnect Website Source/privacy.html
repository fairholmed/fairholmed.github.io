	<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
	<p>Like most websites, our Websites use cookies and similar technology.  Cookies are small text files that are sent to your computer when you use a website.  A cookie only tracks which computer is logging on to the Websites and tracks

		and go to another one or shut down your browser.</p>

	<h2>How Will We Use The Information About You?</h2>
	<p>We collect the information about you to process your order, manage your account, and if you agree, to email you about other products and services.</p>
	<p>We collect usage information about you when you use the Service.  We will not share your information with any third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
	<p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of 5app, its customers,
		or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.  We may also disclose your personal information to any person, firm or company
		who acquires or proposes to acquire any relevant part of our business to which your information relates or in respect of which it is used.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Websites; any
		transmission is at your own risk.</p>
	<h2>Third Party Content</h2>
	<p>Our Websites are a publishing medium in that anyone may register and then publish information about himself or some other person.  We do not moderate or control what is posted.  If you complain about any of the content on our Websites,
		we shall investigate your complaint. If we feel it may be justified, we shall remove that content while we investigate. Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours,
		or that of the person who posted the content which offends you.  If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.</p>
	<h2>Content You Provide To Us</h2>
	<p>If you provide information to us with a view to it being read, copied, downloaded or used by other people, we accept no responsibility for what that third party may do with it and you acknowledge that you have no control whatever
		as to how it may be used.</p>
	<h2>Data May Be “Processed” Outside the UK</h2>
	<p>Our Websites are hosted within the European Union and by HubSpot, Inc., 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02141 and its affiliates (“HubSpot”) – <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">www.hubspot.com</a>.  We also use outsourced services in countries outside the European Union from time to time in other aspects of our business.  In those cases where any personal data may be processed outside the European Union, we ensure that
		such processing is in conformity with the requirements of the Data Protection Act.</p>
	<p>HubSpot complies with the U.S. – European Union Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from
		European Union member countries. HubSpot has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor
		programme, and to view HubSpot’s certification, please visit <a title="U.S.-EU &amp; U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks " href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/ " target="_blank ">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
	<h2>Your Rights</h2>
	<p>We would like to send you marketing information about 5app products and services.  You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.  We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if
		we intend to use your data for such purposes.  You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting

	<p>The Websites may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.  If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy
		policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>

		us at the address provided above.  Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
